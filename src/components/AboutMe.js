            <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to pursue my long-standing passion for computers and programming, 
              transitioning from my nine-year career as a professional chef.
            </p>
            <p>My interest in technology began at the age of eight when I built my first computer, and I have been deeply enthusiastic about the field ever since.</p>
            <p>I'm <strong>open to job opportunities</strong> where I can contribute, learn, and grow. If you have a suitable opportunity that aligns with my skills, please feel free to contact me.</p>
